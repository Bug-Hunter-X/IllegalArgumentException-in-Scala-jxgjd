This repository contains a simple Scala program that demonstrates how to throw an `IllegalArgumentException`. The program defines a class `MyClass` with a method `myMethod` that throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if a specific condition is not met.  The `bug.scala` file shows the code that throws the exception, and `bugSolution.scala` shows how to handle the exception using try-catch block.  This example is useful for understanding how to use exceptions to handle errors gracefully in Scala.
